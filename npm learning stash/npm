npm -v // checking the version of node package
npm or npm help to view series of npm help codes
npm init // to create package.json


npm init -y or npm init --yes // to accept all the default information when intializing or after intialized

npm get init-whatever you want to get or check eg npm get init-author-name


npm config delete init-author-name // to delete the name of the author

npm install "whatever i want to install" --save 
what we are trying to install is a dependency or third party library or framework and it is needed to be saved in the package.json file as dependencies which i use -- save


npm install whatever i want to install --save-dev (the --save-dev  is to node modules in the package.json file as dev.dependencies which is used in the development stage)

npm install --production (is only used to install the dependencies and no the dependencies) but to install both the dependencies and devdependencies we use     npm install 



to uninstall or remove (i can use npm unistall , npm un, npm rm) then --save-dev (for devdependencies)  --save (for dependencies)


to install a particular version 
npm install eg:lodash@4.17.3 --save

npm install eg:gulp@4.17.3 --save-dev (for devdependencies)


to update the version
npm update lodash


npm install -g nodemon
installing the nodemon package makes things easier while working or making changes it automatically upload or reloads the browser or the project 


npm rm -g nodemon
to remove nodemon

npm rm  live-server -g
to remove live-server


to stop the nodemon from working
ctrl c

npm list 
to list the packages/dependencies in the package.json file

or npm list --depth 0
to list the first of dependencies in the package.json file

or npm list --depth 1
to list the second or stage 2 of dependencies in the package.json file

npm install live-server-g (globally) 
installing the live-server-g package makes me run any directory to a local host or local server to view the page on the browser

npm install live-server-

for scripts in the package.json file is used to carry out operations with ease by adding a script to the specific task and running the name of the script with npm
1. it is easier for other devs to work on my project without checking the main file name or live server or they just need the scripts name and npm eg npm start, npm run dev or npm test.... then it automatically replaces the work of  npm index.js



to install things globally on the system we use npm install -g then what we want to install


shortcut to install a third party in devdependencies
npm install -D uuid
